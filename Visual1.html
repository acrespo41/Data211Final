<h1>Stock Decline After March 2020 Across Multiple Industries</h1>

<p> For Figure 1, we plotted the monthly adjusted close stock price for each
  industry. We selected five of the top firms in each industry and averaged
  their adjusted close stock price per month. We believe any impact to the top
  five companies is reflective of what is occurring in the entire industry,
  given that they hold more market power than smaller firms. Furthermore, they
  have more resources to be resilient to change. Our timeline for this
  visualization was January 2019 to February 2021. We wanted to observe trends
  before the pandemic, directly after it hit the United States, and in the
  months following. We included a vertical dotted line to indicate when the
  World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic to allow the
  audience to see trends before and after the pandemicâ€™s official beginning.
  For each industry, we also included a horizontal dotted line to indicate the
  mean adjusted close stock price, and we printed the mean on the far left.</p>


<p> According to Figure 1, all industries took a hit a few weeks following the
  pandemic, and were all already in a decline a few weeks prior. We suspect that
  this decline occurred because by that point the pandemic had hit other
  countries. Seeing how the pandemic affected other parts of the world may have
  made stockholders nervous, causing them to withdraw prematurely. Overall,
  the technology industry was least impacted by the pandemic. Unlike hotel or
  food services, technology services can be provided remotely, so we suspect
  that this is why technology had an easier time adjusting to the pandemic.
  In the months following the pandemic, stock prices of all industries climbed,
  and all but the airline industry reached their mean adjusted close stock prices.
  Figure 1 relates to our overall purpose because we can show changes in stock
  prices of each industry over the course of the pandemic and compare them to
  each other.</p>
