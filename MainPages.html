<h1>Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Industry Stock Prices </h1>

<h2> Overview and Purpose </h2>
<p> Our project analyzes the daily adjusted close stock prices of six
  industries during the period of January 2019 to April 2021 to visualize
  the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. An adjusted close stock price is
  the final price for a stock traded during market hours revised to reflect
  the stock’s true value and accounts for corporate actions. Our purpose
  is to understand and assess how the pandemic affected industries as well
  as analyze the variation within these industries. This investigation can
  be a tool to study monetary impacts on different parts of the economy and
  to support efficient distribution of government relief funds.</p>

<p> We chose to observe the technology, pharmaceutical, airline, hotel,
  restaurant, and alcohol industries with the expectation that they are
  likely to be greatly affected by the pandemic, whether that be positively
  or negatively. Our comprehensive timeline ensures that we have an accurate
  examination of stock prices before and after the pandemic’s inception.
  For all three figures, we averaged the daily adjusted close stock prices
  of five companies in each industry. This method allows us to get a general
  understanding of how the industry overall is doing, but it may limit and
  skew our findings. </p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p> With our visualizations, we have achieved our purpose and gained insight
  into how various industries’ stock prices have changed during the COVID-19
  pandemic. However, correlation is not the same as causation. As a result,
  further analysis is necessary to determine if and to what degree the pandemic
   has been the cause of these industry changes. If we were to continue with
   this project in the future, we would include more companies in the data to
   get a more accurate view of each industry. We would also look into the food
   industry to compare changes in fast food restaurants with sit-down restaurants.
   Additionally, we would have liked to look at stay-at-home orders and remote
   work environments and observe how that may have impacted various industries,
   especially the tech industry. Overall, our project was successful in reaching
    our goals and may be helpful for government allocation of pandemic relief aid.</p>
