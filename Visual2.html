<h1>Comparative View of Stock Price Fluctations Using Percentage Change</h1>

<p> Figure 2 utilizes the same data as Figure 1, but provides a more normalized
  and readily comparable view of how industries were affected by COVID-19. In
  order to visualize the effects of the pandemic, we plotted the monthly
  percentage change from the beginning of 2019 to February 2021. We created
  this visualization to be interactive and chose Tableau as the platform to do
  this. Tooltips include the date, the industry, and the number of recorded
  COVID cases in the US on that date. Furthermore, the viewer can select a
  single line in the legend to see one industry specifically. Because our other
  visualizations <a href="Visual1.html">[Figure 1]</a> <a href="Visual3.html">[Figure 3]</a>
  utilize subplots, we thought it would be helpful for ease of comparison to
  have overlapping lines that use a normalized measure of assessing change. </p>


<p> As mentioned before, the technology industry appeared to fluctuate the
  least throughout the course of the pandemic. Conversely, the airline industry
  fluctuated the most, both positively and negatively, with deep dips and high
  percentage growth after the pandemic began to fall more under control/the economy
  began reopening. The hotel industry also experienced high fluctuations that were
  comparable to the airline industry. This similarity may be due to the fact that
  airlines/hotels attract a similar set of customers. Finally, something interesting
  on this visualization is that there were still a decent number of cases when some
  industries experienced positive growth. This trend indicates that reopening the
  economy may not have coincided with a significant reduction in caseloads. </p>
