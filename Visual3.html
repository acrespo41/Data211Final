<h1>Tech Companies Were Resilient to Pandemic but Key Differences in Company Size</h1>

<p> Figure 3 examines the percentage change of the average daily adjusted close
  stock price of differently sized technology companies between January 2020 and
  April 2021. We used market capitalizations as a measure of size for the companies
  used in the figure as it reflects the market value of all shares of a
  corporation’s stock and can determine a company’s overall worth and growth.
  A market capitalization of $10 billion USD or greater corresponds to large-sized
  companies, an estimate of $2 billion to $10 billion USD is mid-sized, and market
  capitalizations between $300 million to $2 billion designate small-sized companies.
  We included five companies for each of the groups, averaged their stock prices,
  and calculated the percentage change. </p>

<p> Figure 3 shows all three groups were not significantly impacted by the pandemic.
  However, there was an expected decrease around March 2020, yet stock prices percent
  changes hovered around zero afterwards. Larger companies fluctuate the least,
  whereas medium and smaller companies varied the most. This trend makes sense, as
  larger companies have the financial and managerial resources to mitigate risks
  compared to corporations with fewer employees and less money. Medium-sized companies
  appear to have the sharpest decline and fluctuations between mid-February and early
  April. As time progressed after the initial decline, smaller-sized companies seem
  to sustain percent change fluctuations between 8% and -6% into the summer of 2020.
  This trend suggests that smaller companies have experienced a longer period of
  adjustment after the first stock declines. Overall, the graph indicates that the
  tech industry may not be a top priority when it comes to allocating financial support,
  and further analyses may conclude that these companies are potentially thriving. </p>
